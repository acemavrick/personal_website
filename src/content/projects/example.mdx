## The Beginning: A File is Born

Once upon a time in the `/src/content/projects/` directory, a humble MDX file was created. That file is **this very page you're reading right now**. At the top, wrapped in triple dashes, lives the frontmatter—a YAML block containing metadata like `title`, `date`, `tech`, and `summary`.

This frontmatter isn't just decoration. It's validated by a schema defined in `content.config.ts` using Zod:

```typescript
const projects = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.string(),
    tech: z.array(z.string()),
    summary: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

If invalid data gets added, Astro throws errors during build. Type safety in content? *Chef's kiss*.

## The Journey: From Slug to Page

Here's where it gets interesting. The filename of this MDX file (let's say `example.mdx`) becomes its **slug**. When you navigate to `/projects/example`, Astro's dynamic routing kicks in.

The `[slug].astro` file in `/src/pages/projects/` is doing the heavy lifting:

1. **getStaticPaths()** runs at build time
2. It fetches all projects using `getCollection("projects")`
3. Each project gets mapped to a route based on its filename
4. The MDX content gets rendered into beautiful HTML

It's like a factory assembly line, but for web pages:

```
example.mdx → slug: "example" → /projects/example → this page!
```

## The Tech Tags: Colorful Companions

Notice those colorful pill-shaped tags at the top? Each technology in the `tech` array gets its own `<TechTag>` component. The component looks at the tech name and assigns it a color:

- Languages like Python and TypeScript get specific colors
- Frameworks like React and Svelte get their own hues  
- Everything else gets a default neutral style

Adding something like `["Rust", "Go", "Swift"]` to the frontmatter makes the tags adapt automatically. It's like a chameleon, but for code.

### How Tags Know Their Colors

The `TechTag.astro` component uses a simple mapping system. When it sees "TypeScript", it knows to render a blue tag. When it encounters "Python", out comes yellow. This makes your tech stack instantly recognizable at a glance.

## The Content: MDX Superpowers

Below the frontmatter, regular markdown can be written—**bold text**, *italics*, `inline code`, headings, lists, the works. But MDX takes it further: HTML and even React components can be mixed in (though this example sticks to vanilla markdown).

Want a gradient text effect? Just sprinkle in some Tailwind:

<span class="bg-clip-text bg-linear-to-r from-rose-500 via-green-500 to-orange-500 text-transparent font-bold text-xl"
>Look at me, I'm a gradient!</span>

import rose from '/rose.txt?raw';

<pre class="not-prose whitespace-pre leading-[1.05] bg-conic from-rose-500 via-blue-500 to-orange-500 text-transparent bg-clip-text font-mono overflow-x-scroll scroll-auto [scrollbar-width:none] [-ms-overflow-style:none] [&::-webkit-scrollbar]:hidden" 
style="font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', monospace;" 
set:html={rose} />

</span>


The prose styling from Tailwind Typography makes everything readable automatically. Headers get proper spacing, paragraphs breathe, code blocks shine.

## The Styling: Layers of Beauty

When the MDX renders, it's wrapped in a `<Base>` layout that provides:

1. A radial gradient background fading from zinc-800 to zinc-950
2. Responsive padding and max-width constraints
3. The prose classes that make typography beautiful
4. Syntax highlighting for code blocks

The content lives in an `<article>` tag with careful spacing, so everything from the `h1` title down to the last paragraph has room to breathe.

## How New Projects Get Added

Creating a new project page is surprisingly simple:

1. A new `.mdx` file gets dropped in `/src/content/projects/`
2. The required frontmatter gets added (title, date, tech, summary)
3. Content gets written using markdown
4. The file gets saved—Astro's dev server hot-reloads
5. The page appears at `/projects/filename`

No database. No CMS. No build configuration. Just **write and ship**.

## The Grand Finale

And that's the story of how a simple MDX file becomes a full-fledged project page. From content collections to dynamic routes to styled components—it's a beautiful dance of static site generation.

The best part? This entire system is type-safe, version-controlled, and infinitely customizable. Adding a `github` field to the schema? Just update `content.config.ts`. Custom components in MDX? Import them directly. The possibilities are endless.

And that's the magic behind these project pages—simple files transformed into beautiful documentation.
