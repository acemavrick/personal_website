## About

This project was a fun side thing I worked on because I wanted to get some 
analytics on my texts with a couple of friends. Through it, I was able to learn
a bit about SQLite, Jupyter notebooks, and data analysis & display with Python.

I found a [tool](https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter) online that 
would export my iMessage history, and I wrote a script to build an
SQLite database from the exported data. I then wrote a Jupyter notebook to
analyze the database and get some analytics, such as sent vs recieved ratio,
message rate over time, characters transferred over time, etc. It revealed some
pretty interesting insights and trends.

I was considering doing some sentiment analysis and other stuff, but decided to
move on to other projects. I may still revisit this project someday, but for now,
it's archived.
