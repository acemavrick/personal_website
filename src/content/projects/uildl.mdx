{/* ## Current Status <span class="text-base text-gray-400 font-normal align-middle ml-2">(as of December 26, 2025)</span>

I'm working on a new version of the desktop application,
which will be more polished, performant, and maintainable. I plan to 
build the application using SvelteKit and Tauri (a Rust-based framework).
I intend to learn Rust through the process, so a full rewrite is inevitable.
However, I might publish a version in the interim that uses a Python server
to manage all the backend logic while I am rewriting it in Rust.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know! */}

## Current Status (Devlog) <span class="text-base text-gray-400 font-normal align-middle ml-2">(as of February 5, 2026)</span>

Long devlog, did a lot of work. TL;DR: the app has been improved and features have been added. Almost there to a beta release.

The earlier version of this app was bad in a lot of ways. It didn't work on some Windows machines, didn't support Linux, was slow, and was pretty buggy on top of all that. It failed at being cross platform, and was hard to maintain and build for other systems (I only have a Mac). So I decided to rebuild it from the ground up (mostly) to fix the issues and make improvements.

Firstly, by building this in Rust and SvelteKit using the Tauri framework, I have made it much easier to develop so that it supports multiple platforms. It is also much faster at doing its job and more responsive, since the frontend is SvelteKit (a huge improvement over HTMX). This fixed a lot of the bugs (although I haven't yet tried to build for Windows) and was by itself a major improvement in the app. I don't have to track and maintain source code for different systems (especially metadata) – everything is the same, and Tauri manages most of the rest (including the icons!). 

Secondly, I made more optimizations to the app design. Earlier, I was using a database to store all the contests. That was me being overeager – around 600 items does not warrant a whole sqlite database. So I just stored it in memory. This simplifies a LOT of the cache management stuff and reduces a bunch of complexity. I just scan files on disk and store it in an array-type structure, which is quicker and simpler. I also removed the .cache_manifest file as it was not providing any significant benefit – and makes my life as a developer easier (I don't have to worry about users messing with it, or of updating it, etc.). So the only files that are managed and hidden from the user are the config and info.json files. I also implemented a download queue with rate limiting, which is a big QoL improvement. This, along with the filters and updated searching (fuzzy, exact, and regex, w/optional case sensitivity) is a benefit of using SvelteKit as a frontend. 

I think that the app looks and feels far better than it did before. It launches fast, downloads efficiently (with full transparency to the user, should they wish to see it), and is more simple and intuitive to use. Of course, I have to test it widely and implement a couple more features before releasing a primary version.

What next? I am planning on adding a simpler usersettings/config file that I can also *edit remotely* (so in a way, remote updates). I then need to verify the update system to the new config layout and the info.json file. I then need to add analytics and telemetry – I am thinking about pivoting away from GA to something simpler, more private, and easier to set up. After that, I'll add a notification system so that I (as a developer) can send out notifications, like if there are problems, updates, or I just want to survey people. And then finally, if I see that it works, I can ship a beta version (which will also coincide with a ship on this platform). There are further improvements I want to make, but they are more QoL than necessity and I can procrastinate on those.

## Background

In 1910, the University of Texas at Austin started a program called the
"University Interscholastic League", or UIL for short. In their own words,
this league exists to "provide educational extracurricular academic,
athletic, and music contests" ([source](https://www.uiltexas.org/about)).

UIL Academics is the branch of UIL that is responsible for the academic competitions.
These competitions cover a wide range of subjects, including english, math, science,
social studies, spelling, etc. You can find the whole list [here](https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/academic-contests).
For the past few years, the past tests were locked behind a paywall, making it difficult
for all students to study for the competitions. But recently, the tests have been
made available for free to all students online. 

However, the way the tests are organized and presented can be quite difficult to navigate. For example,
the materials for 2025 are located [here](https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/page/2025-high-school-academic-study-materials),
and the materials for 2021 can be found [here](https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/page/2021-high-school-academic-study-materials).
While it is easy to go to earlier years' tests, the lack of future links on the side
means that it is necessary to edit the URL manually to go to the next year's materials.
Furthermore, the files have inconsistend names, making it difficult to organize, and 
downloading them has to be done individually.

My solution to these inconveniences was to make a tool that would allow me to 
provide a different interface for the materials and allow me to download them
all at once.

I present to you: [UIL-DL](https://uildl.randeria.dev).

## Development

UIL-DL started off as a project to help me study for the contests. I got tired of
downloading the materials individually, and tended to lose them anyway, especially
because of how inconsistent the file names were. In my mind, this had perfect potential
to be a web-scraping project. Using Python and BeautifulSoup, I was able to build a 
small script that would go through every year's materials and get the download links
to the files. 

### Organizing the Data
I would say that one of the harder parts of the project was organizing and displaying
the files in a way that was easy to understand and use. 

Most of them were just a single PDF per contest (Invitational A, District, Region, etc.),
but some of them included multiple levels at once (the 'Study Packets') while the 
programming contests had an additional link to contest data, which usually
went to Box links (or other cloud storage). I had to handle those separately (I
basically had the user just download them manually). 

Then there were naming inconsistencies. For example, for science, 2019's state 
packet was named `Science_StudyPacket_S_19.pdf`, while 2022's was named 
`Science_S_22.pdf`, and 2023's was named `Science_Study_Packet_s_23.pdf`. This was
somewhat trivial to handle – I just had to tweak my scraping to build a format based
on the headings that the links were under (which were more consistent). I also had
to do some manual formatting (I defined substitutions to be used) in order to ensure
consistent file output. You can see the full list of links [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acemavrick/uil-dl/refs/heads/v-2/data/info.json)
(the substitutions are at the end of the file).

### Building the App
Once I was able to get the links and build a standardized database of 
contest information paired with links, downloading and organizing the files was a breeze.
For the longest time, I was just using temporary Python scripts to download the files,
but I realized that this would be useful for other people to use – and the majority
of people that could benefit from this wouldn't have the technical knowledge to use
the Python scripts. So I moved on to making an actual application. 

I decided to make a website that I would then embed using `pywebview` and then build executable files
from that. I used HTMX paired with Tailwind CSS and some heavy use of JavaScript to
make a dynamic and responsive table-based interface. The user could click on rows
to select files they wanted to download, and then click a button to download all 
selected files (in bulk). 

From a utility point of view, the application worked well (though it was somewhat buggy).
I polished things up the best I could at the time (I was learning to ship as I went,
and not wait on prefection), and started the process of building executable files.

Building the executables was *way more* than a bit of a pain.

Everything was set up and working in the Python environment. I just had to build the
executable. Just a simple step using `pyinstaller`, and then I was done. But nope.
I ran into multiple issues when using `pyinstaller` to build the executable for
Windows and Linux machines (I was and am still a macOS user). Firstly, having access to only
a MacBook meant that I had to rely on a VM (QEMU) and/or my friend's machine to
build and test the executable. Then, something would go wrong nearly all the time:
it wouldn't start up, the executable would get corrupted, something 
about .NET stuff and the like. I spent a lot of time trying to work it out and 
ultimately gave up and switched to using Nuitka to build the executable. Nuitka
is different from `pyinstaller` in that it compiles the Python code into C/C++ code.
I was hoping that that would be better since it doesn't need to package the Python interpreter
and libraries with the executable. But that had its own set of issues. After a bunch
of trial and error, and reading docs, and struggling, I finally was able to build it
on all Windows (I gave up on Linux – they can build it from source). And it worked...
at least on some systems. There were some issues with it running on certain systems,
(something about .NET), and the build process took a long time. I just released
those executables anyway [on github](https://github.com/acemavrick/uil-dl/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta)
and started working on a new version of the application. Since that first release,
which has quite a few bugs, I haven't released any new desktop executables.

### UIL-DL Online

This time around, I decided to scrap all the pywebview stuff and make a smaller
tkinter-based application that would prompt the user to open the interface
in their own browser. I was hoping that this would be easier to build and distribute,
at the cost of a slightly less polished interface.

I continued in that way for some time, as I built the interface using SvelteKit
and Tailwind CSS. I got a lot of the display logic working, including selection
and filtering and searching and sorting and all that good stuff. It was definitely
a big improvement over the previous version, being smoother and much more responsive.

When I got to the part where I had to build the system to actually download the files,
I kind of pivoted to just making a website. I had been told from multiple independent
sources that it would be great to have something that would be accessible from any device,
without an install. I basically already had that by now, so I just made a couple of tweaks
and then published it as the "online" version of UIL-DL, which you can try out [here](https://uildl.randeria.dev/online).
While this doesn't have the "resource management" aspect of the previous version,
it is much more accessible and easier to use.

But that doesn't mean that I'm done.

### Future Plans

I still plan on making a 2.0 version of UIL-DL, which would be a desktop application
that would mimic the interface of the online version, but with the ability to download
files directly to the computer, and to manage the files on the computer. This was put
on pause due to my schedule and other priorities (college applications), but I may
get around to it eventually, if only just to fix bugs and have a pretty usable app.

I'm also considering hosting the files on my own server, so that I can have more control
over the permanency and accessibility of the files. This would also allow me to
add more features, such as splitting the answer keys from the practice tests. But this
is a bit more tentative than the other plans that I have in mind, and may not happen.
Splitting the answer keys would be a lot of work, and I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.
I'll give $10 to anyone willing to do so (joke).

## Conclusion

UIL-DL was a fun and interesting project to work on. I learned a lot about
web scraping, web development, desktop application development, and more.
I'm proud of the work that I did on it, and I'm glad that I was able to help
others study for the contests. Based on the limited analytics on the app 
(over 500 packets were downloaded through this!) and feedback I've received,
it seems that it has been helpful to some people, which is a great feeling.

I'm writing this in December 2025, and expect for there to be an uptick in usage
soon, as the competition season is starting... but we'll see how it goes.
