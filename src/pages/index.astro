		I'm planning this site
		(or at least the home/project page) to be more narrative. 
		This would include paragraphs and comments before each section of projects
		instead of a big wall of projects.This layout is
		demoed here, and is obviously a work in progress.

	<p class="fade-up delay-6 paragraph-section">
		As you can see, there are a selection of projects displayed here.
		(They're all examples right now). This section changes dynamically based
		on the number of projects and screen sizes. This text area would be where
		I would write about the projects directly below it, and can put some context
		or summary of the projects.
